            Introduction to C 
 C is a 
    i. It is a high Level / middle Level Programming language.
    
    What is Progrm ?
    -> Set of instruction is called program.
    What is a software ?
    Set of programms is called software or as per IT industry 
    Software is a digitalized and automated process.

    Software are of 2 types
    i.System Software
    ex- Operating system,device drivers
    ii.Application Software
    ex- Whatsapp,facebook etc
    What is a language ?
    -> The language like telugu/english/hindi etc are called human lang ,which are used to communicate with human
    ->The computer programming lang like c /java/ rust are used to write the programs [software] to communicate with the machines.
    Basically these lang are divided into 3 types
    i.Machine Lang : created with binary code
    ex.1010101
    ii.Low level lang or assmbly lang : created with English like shortcuts called "MNEMONICS"
    ex. gd mrg
    iii. High Level lang :created with simple English
    ex.good morning
    
    C is a high level lang with low level features. Hence it is also called middle level lang 
    C low level features used to design system software
    high level features to build application software 
    "C is a multi purpose language."





 2 ---> C is a compiler based programming language ?

    what is called  translator ? 
    -> converting one form to another 
 
        Translators does the following
        1. Checking errors and Warnings
             a. Compile time errors: When programmer is not following the programming rules , the system gives complile time errors [ Syntatical errors].
             b. Runtime Error: As a programmer we are folllowing all the rules but the system is unable to give the correct answer then it gives runtime error.
             c. Warning : with warning we can execute the program 


             black window is called command prompt 
             and blue window is called IDE
