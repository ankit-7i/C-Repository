SWITCH CONDITIONAL STATEMENT

It is a selection statement.
It is used to execute one case of statements from no
of cases according to the switch expression value
matched with case expression value. In switch the
program is jumped to matching case like the go to
label.
It is similar to ladder if in working style.
Switch performance is high when compared with
ladder if because of it jumps to matching case.

Syntax:
switch(condition / expression)
{
case constexp1:
statements;
break;
case constexp2:
statements;
break;
case constexpN:
statements;
break;
[ default: statements; ]
}
Here switch, case, break, default are the keywords.
In between case and case expression / value at least
one space should be provided. Otherwise it will
become a label.

case expression/value should be a constant
integer/char value. i.e. float / string not allowed.
One case contains one expression only.
case expression doesn’t contain any separators
like , . etc.
case expression should be end with : (colon)
Each case should be separated with break keyword.
Otherwise remaining cases also executed.
Duplicate cases not allowed.
default is similar to the else and all cases are failed
then default statements are executed. Default is
optional and we can declare it anywhere in our
switch.
Outside case expressions not considered in switch.
1. Case value should be a const int.
2. Variables not allowed in case.
3. Float / string not allowed.
4. Duplicate cases not allowed.
5. Case and case value have to separated
with at least one space.

6. If space not provided then it is converted
into a label.
7. Every case should be end with :
8. Break is optional and when it is not
there, remaining case also executed until
the next break is occurred.
9. Case doen’t allows range of values.
10. Case doesn’t allows , . like separators,
11. Default is optional and working similar to
else. We can declare default anywhere.
12. Switch, case, break and default are the
keywords.
