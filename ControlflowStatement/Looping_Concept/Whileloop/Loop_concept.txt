Loops / Iterations / Repetitive statements
Loops are used to repeat a block/group of
statements continuously until the given
condition becomes false.

Loops reduce program size and improves
performance.
In loops beginning and ending points are
same.

C-Language supports basically 2 types of
loops.
1. Entry/pre controlled loops.
2. Exit/post controlled loops.
In entry control loops, condition is tested
first and it is true then only statements
block is executed.

Under entry control loops we are having
i. While loop
ii. For loop
In exit control loop, the statements are
executed first and later condition is tested.

Under exit control loop we are having
i. do while.

While loop:

 while is a keyword.
 In while loop condition is tested first
and it is true then only while block
statements are executed. After executing
while block statements, the program
execution automatically shifted/jumped to
while condition at the beginning. If it is
true then once again the while block
statements are repeated. Like this the
process is continued until while condition
becomes false.
 While is entry control loop.
