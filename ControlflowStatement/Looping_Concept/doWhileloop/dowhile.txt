do..while:
 It is an exit control loop. i.e. in a do
while the condition is tested at last.
 Here do , while are the keywords.

 It is also used to repeat a program
several times based on a condition.
 In a do while, do block statements are
executed first and later while condition
is tested. If the while condition is true
then once again the do block
statements are repeated. Like this the
process is continued until the while
condition becomes false.
 In do while, the while should be end
with semicolon ( ; ) .
 Regardless of while condition, the do
statements are executed at least one
time. Due to this sometimes we are
getting unwanted results [ garbage
values ].

 Use do while whenever it is compulsory
because of in do while the program is
controlled at the bottom / last.
