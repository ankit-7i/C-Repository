for loop:
It is an entry control loop.
for is a keyword.

It is also used to repeat a program several
times based on a condition.

When compared with while and do while,
for loop is looking to be smart. In for it is
compulsory to maintain two semicolons.
For works without condition also and
default condition is always 1 i.e. true.
Generally for loop is having 3 expressions.
1. Initialization
2. Test condition / expression
3. Increment/decrement / updation
At first entry of for loop the initialization
part is executed and later the test
condition is checked. If the condition is
true then the for block statements are
executed. After completion of the block,

the increment or decrement part is
executed. Later once again the test
condition is evaluated. If it is true then
once again for block statements are
executed. Like this the process is continued
until the condition becomes false. Here the
initialization part is executed only once, at
the time of loop beginning.

It is mandatory to maintain 2 semicolon ( ;
) in a for loop.
If the for loop is having more than three
expressions, it is mandatory to separate
the expressions with , separator.

If the for loop is having less than three
expressions, then leave the expressions
with empty semicolon.
