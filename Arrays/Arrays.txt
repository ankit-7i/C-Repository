ARRAYS

It is collection of homogeneous [same type] variables.
Array is nothing but collection of contiguous memory
locations, where we can store and manage more than one
value of same type under one name.
It is a derived data type.
It is an implicit / internal pointer.
It is a implicit const pointer
It is one of data structure.
Advantages:
Generally to store several values of same type, we have to
declare several variables. Here we have to remember all
these variable names also. When the program is too big, it is
very difficult to remember all the variable names. In this
situation, the only solution is array.
Array reduce program length.
Array minimize the errors.
In functions to carry several values of same type at a time,
we are using arrays.
It allows to arrange our data in a order.
Disadvantage:

Array size is Constant Positive Integer value. Due to this we
are not able to change the array size at run time. Sometimes
it causes memory wastage / shortage.
In C language we are using
1. One dimensional arrays
2. Multi dimensional arrays
One dimensional arrays:
 An array with one row and several columns.
 An array with single subscripting operator [ ] is called
one dimensional array.
 It is an implicit single pointer.
Syntax:

datatype variable[size] = {elements};

Eg:
int a[4] = { 9, 3, 1, 8 };
Memory allocation for array:

Array is implicit pointer because of array variable stores
base cell [ 0 cell 1st byte ] address. Hence array variable
value and 0 cell address both are same.
